# Documentation Standard — what good documentation is

The canonical house standard for documentation quality. Like the coding
standard, the scaffold copies this file into **every scaffolded repo** as
`docs/writing-documentation.md`; the review bot checks PRs against it
(`repo_context_files`). The companion standard —
`docs/documentation-structure.md` — mandates the required doc set and
folder structure; this file is the rules for the writing itself. The
`skill://write-documentation` skill is the process that applies both.

## Skills are documentation

A skill (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) is documentation: it is a doc written
for the agent that loads it, and it is subject to every rule in this
standard — context efficiency, density, no-duplication, one topic per file
(a skill covers one task or procedure; a second task means a second skill),
the quality checklist, and the always-loaded size ceilings (a skill body is
loaded in full when used, so the 150–200 line / 32 KiB targets apply to it
directly). The review bot checks skill changes against this standard like
any other doc.

## Context efficiency

Every documentation file contains only information relevant to its topic
and audience. Each doc has a single topic and a single audience. Content
that belongs to a different audience or topic goes in that doc, linked —
never copied in.

All documentation must be usable by humans or by AI agents; both navigate
from the entry point of AGENTS.md.

## AGENTS.md is a bootloader, not an operating system

AGENTS.md loads everything else and gets out of the way. It holds the quick
start, the decision tree that routes every task to the right doc, and the
rules that apply to **every** agent in the repo — nothing more. Content that
only some agents need belongs in the doc the tree links to, never in
AGENTS.md itself. Test: is this genuinely relevant to 100% of agents
working in this repo? If not, it does not belong in the bootloader.

## Single source of truth — never duplicate

Each piece of information lives in exactly one place. Other docs link to
it; they do not repeat it. A duplicated fact is a finding: the copies
drift, and the reader cannot tell which is current. When tempted to copy
content into a second doc, link instead — the link is the
duplication-free way to reuse.

**Good:** the development guide says "See the column reference for
details" and links to column-reference.md.

**Bad:** the development guide repeats the column layout inline — two
copies, one of which will go stale.

## One topic per file — the docs' separation of concerns

One reason to change per doc file, exactly as one reason to change per
module (docs/coding-standards.md 'Separation of concerns'): each doc
covers one topic for one audience. A doc with two audiences or two
unrelated topics is a finding — split it and link. A subtopic for a
different audience is a separate file that links back. The question
before writing or editing: "what single question does this doc answer?" —
a second question means a second file.

## Avoid redundancy

Before adding content to a doc, check whether it already exists elsewhere.
If it does, link to it. If it does not, put it in the most logical place
and link from the other docs.

## Delete, don't archive

Obsolete content is a liability. When something is no longer accurate,
delete it. Don't rename it "legacy", don't add a deprecation notice. If
it's wrong, remove it.

## Docs must match the code

When you rename a function, module, or tab, update the docs in the same
commit. When you add a feature, document it before moving on. Outdated
docs are noise.

## API keys never go in docs

API keys, passwords, and secrets never appear in documentation or `.env`
files. They live in the shell environment only.

## Density & concision

Docs are read inside a limited AI context window; every sentence costs
context. Write for density: the smallest set of words that preserves every
fact and decision.

- **Rules as explicit negatives.** "Never X" reads faster and is followed
  more reliably than "be careful about X".
- **Commands over prose.** `make test` beats "run the test suite to verify
  everything works".
- **Tables over prose.** A rule per row beats a paragraph per rule, when a
  fact has consistent fields.
- **Canonical ✗/✓ examples over exhaustive enumeration.** One right/wrong
  pair teaches more than a list of edge cases; never enumerate every
  failure mode, show the pattern.
- **One-line contracts.** `compute()` MUST return an `Attempt` — prefer one
  line over three sentences.
- **Decision-relevant context only.** Keep only background that changes a
  decision; cut filler, restated motivation, and restated rules.
- **Size ceilings.** Always-loaded files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, skill
  bodies) target ~150–200 lines / <32 KiB — loaded in full every session,
  so bloat is paid every session. Referenced docs can be longer, but
  densify prose first.
- **Link, don't paste.** A fact lives in exactly one place; other docs link
  to it. References one level deep — a doc points to another doc, not
  through a chain.
- **Task-shaped sections.** When a doc describes how to do something, use
  the task-card shape: goal (one verb), scope (exact paths), constraints
  (must / never), acceptance (verifiable command).

## The documentation-quality checklist

- [ ] Single, clearly stated audience
- [ ] Single, clearly stated topic
- [ ] No content that belongs to a different doc
- [ ] No duplicated content from other docs (link instead)
- [ ] Every section is relevant to the stated audience
- [ ] Title and first paragraph make the purpose clear
- [ ] Links to related docs where readers might need them
- [ ] Every sentence carries a fact, a decision, or a constraint
- [ ] Rules are explicit negatives ("Never X"), not vague preferences
- [ ] Commands replace descriptions where executable
- [ ] Tables replace paragraphs where fields are consistent
- [ ] Code shows a canonical ✗/✓ pair, not exhaustive cases
- [ ] Always-loaded files within the ~150–200 line ceiling
